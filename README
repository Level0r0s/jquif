JqUIF
==============

Classes to generate JQuery UI from a CGI in free pascal.
Demo can be view here : http://test.myvirtspace.com/cgi-bin/jquery/

What is working ?

  - Accordion,  
  - Buttons,
  - Datepicker,
  - Dialog,
  - Resizer,
  - Tabs,  

  - Basic events management,
  - Basic autocomplete

  - Form validator (based on jquery plugin validation http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/)
  - DataGrid (based on jqgrid http://www.trirand.com/blog/)

What to do ?

A lot !
Better support of events, support of the ajax API, the code could be better...
But for now, it works for my needs, so if you want to help, you're welcome !
